The R package **chents** provides some utilities for working with chemical 
entities in R.

## Features

- Some chemical information is retrieved from the PubChem website using the webchem 
package
- If Python and RDKit (> 2015.03) are installed and configured for use with
  'reticulate', some basic chemoinformatics functions some additional chemical
  information is computed and a 2D graph can be plotted
- Additional information can be read from a local .yaml file

## Examples

Some examples are available from the 
[reference on jrwb.de](https://pkgdown.jrwb.de/chents/reference).
