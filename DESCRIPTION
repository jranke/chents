Description: Utilities for dealing with chemical entities and associated
    data as R objects. If Python and RDKit (> 2015.03) are installed and
    configured for use with 'PythonInR', some basic chemoinformatics functions
    like the calculation of molecular weight and plotting of chemical
    structures in R graphics are available. For plotting, you need
    grConvert (https://sjp.co.nz/projects/grconvert) which is not on CRAN.
